# Abstract
The report analyses the Census data of the year 2016 for the County Kildare, Ireland. The data is obtained from the Central Statistics Office website where we can find gazillions of data about Ireland’s people, society and economy which is impartially collected, analysed and these statistics are made available for all of us. The Four key goals are: 
1.To illustrate the Demographic breakdown of Male , Female and age groups. 
1.To illustrate the the number of Males over 75+ in 2016.
1.To illustrate the number of Males over 75+ in 2020 using predictive analysis.
1.Final Goal is to visualise the problem statement: if 1 in 3 of the Males 75+ has visited a GP Clinic in the last year, and of those 1/3 have visited 3 times in the year at an average of 15 minutes per consultation.

# Overview of the dataset
The report provides information obtained through multiple analysis regarding the Age Structure, individual Gender Population and the Total Population of the county Kildare for the year 2016. This report will pay particular attention to the trends in Age Structure and highlight the most populated Age Group. It also sketches the proportion of Population of Sex in different Age Groups and accounts for the Age Group which are below or above the Median Population Percent.

Finally, with some assumptions, we can predict the Male Population over the different Age Groups. In the first part of the project – Cleaning and Preprocessing the Data, I introduced the County Kildare Census dataset, cleaned the data and transformed it into a form suitable for further analysis. Secondly, I performed exploratory data analysis which helped to answer the questions above. A variety of packages were used for this exercise. Each analysis has been explained along with its codes.
